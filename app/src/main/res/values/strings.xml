    <string name="title_intro_anchor_6">Benefits of Anchoring</string>
    <string name="title_intro_anchor_7">Anchoring Tips</string>
    <string name="description_intro_anchor_1">The concept of anchoring is based on the established learning principle of classical or Pavlovian conditioning.</string>
    <string name="description_intro_anchor_2">If a particular song brings back a flood of emotions or a certain scent reminds you of a special someone and puts a spring in your step.</string>
    <string name="description_intro_anchor_3">If the recall of a past event, or the performance of an action calms your nerves and sharpens your focus - you have experienced anchoring.</string>
    <string name="description_intro_anchor_4">Anchoring exercises involve the deliberate “conditioning” of a “cue“ with a particular mental-emotional “state” or behavioural response that elicits a positive outcome.</string>
    <string name="description_intro_anchor_5">A cue can be either verbal or non-verbal, i.e., a cue word, a behaviour, or action. Anchoring is an effective means of bringing about specific positive outcomes.</string>

    <string name="recommend_low_1">Your profile suggests that your readiness for attaining peak state can be significantly improved. None of us were given a user’s guide at birth to fully avail of the resources of our mind and body we need to surmount the challenges and navigate the difficult terrains of life. The good news is that by making a commitment to swiftly adopt and practice new routines, develop new habits suggested here, you can experience an elevation in your peak state score and live a fulfilling life</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_2">How we interpret situations and experiences is largely the result of our inner dialogue, the product of our conscious thoughts and unconscious beliefs and biases. Cultivating healthy, positive self-talk can dramatically determine our success or conversely failure, our attitude, emotions, build or destroy our confidence, our ability to overcome challenges and hardship. Some people liken the habit of positive self-talk to a defence armour or a ladder to take you higher. Make positive self-talk a habit today. (Download the positive self-talk worksheet)</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_3">You’ve experienced the power of anchoring if a particular song brings back a flood of emotions, if the smell of the perfume someone you’re attracted to wears sends your heart fluttering, or if the mention of “ sour lemon juice” is enough to  make your mouth water. Based on the psychological principle of classical conditioning, anchoring is a powerful exercise to help anyone use either a verbal or non-verbal cue to re-experience resourceful mental and physiological states or to transfer cognitive knowledge to other contexts. The regular and disciplined use of anchors can help us develop the confidence to meet situational demands, surmount challenges.</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_4">Nothing good comes about by accident and success takes time to cultivate. Make a decision today and begin taking steps toward building resilience. Utilize the peak state mastery journal to plan routines and carry out resilience-building practices such as visualization, meditation, anchoring.</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_5">Visualization (or mental imagery) is an active, action-based form of meditation that confers a broad spectrum of benefits. Visualization involves the deliberate use of words or self-talk and pictures in our mind to image a specific mental, emotional, physical state and/or outcome. Research supports the efficacy of visualization in a wide variety of contexts, including skill improvement, healing, motivation, and more. Use the visualization exercise guide to reap the benefits that visualization offers.</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_6">Mindful breathing works to regulate arousal, reduce anxiety, and rumination. The simple practice of mindful breathing, when done daily, contributes to raising our threshold for internal and external demands and builds resilience. Select the Mindful Breathing option in the Breathing tool to help regulate your arousal, and to transition into mindfulness meditation.</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_7">Meditation has been evidenced by research to offer widespread benefits, one of which is the development of mindfulness. Mindfulness meditation helps to get in touch with ourselves - mentally and physiologically, enabling us to identify erroneous thinking, emotional dysregulation, correct stress build-up and allowing for a “reset” of our system.</string>
    <string name="recommend_low_8">The combination of music and brainwave entrainment are a potent force in raising or lowering our level of wakefulness, calm our mind, restore our physiology, or alter our mood state.
